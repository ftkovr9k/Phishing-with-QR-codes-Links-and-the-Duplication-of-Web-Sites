The phishing website impersonates the MyBUworks Getting Started page (https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/mybuworks/gettingstarted/), from Boston University. Used to demonstrate how easy it is to and steal user credentials, even with 2-factor authentication in place.

#DISCLAIMER
Phishing is illegal. This was a final project my teammates and I did for EC521 Cybersecurity at Boston University. We took the site down soon after it was demo-ed.
