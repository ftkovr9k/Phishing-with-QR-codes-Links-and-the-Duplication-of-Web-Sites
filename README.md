# Phishing-with-QR-codes-Links-and-the-Duplication-of-Web-Sites
The phishing website impersonates the MyBUworks Getting Started page (https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/mybuworks/gettingstarted/), which was created by Boston University.

#DISCLAIMER

Phishing is illegal. This was a final project my teammates and I did for EC521 Cybersecurity at Boston University. We took the site down soon after it was demo-ed.
